    my felt dolls r lovingly handmade and i would be so grateful for ur 
    order :D !! i spend hours on each one making sure they r super cute !!
    you can customize them exactly how you'd like !! :D i will ask that you 
    provide reference images and will do my very best to be accurate to them !!

    <span class="warn">warning :</span> the glitter and charms are likely to fall off if treated roughly !! >n<
    however, i've taken mine outside / to school before various times 
    and they came back unscathed :D it's generally best to be gentle with 
    them but they should be okay !! ^-^
  </p>

  <p>
    i accept payment in cash only for now ^_^
    dm me on discord or insta <span class=at>@_kaito_lover</span> to place 
    your order !!
